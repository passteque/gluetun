That error usually happens because either:

1. The VPN server IP address you are trying to connect to is no longer valid 🔌
   Check out https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/servers.md#update-the-vpn-servers-list

2. The VPN server crashed 💥, try changing your VPN servers filtering options such as SERVER_REGIONS

3. Your Internet connection is not working 🤯, ensure it works

4. Something else ➡️ https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/issues/new/choose

		level = levelWarn
	case strings.HasPrefix(filtered, "Linux route add command failed: "):
		filtered = "Previous error details: " + filtered
		level = levelWarn
